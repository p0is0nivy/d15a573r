DISASTER MANAGEMENT
-Disaster Management refers to how one can protect or preserve maximum number of lives and property during a natural disaster and have a minimal economic loss. Disaster management plans are multi-layered and are aimed to address such issues as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, landslides etc.

IDEA
-Our idea focuses on how one can predict certain disasters beforehand on the basis of one’s location. Henceforth, we will try to provide the user/victim of the disaster necessary measures to be taken to survive and make a call for help. At the time of a calamity, the location of the user is sent to the respective authorities and the family of the user. Also, the idea has an offline mode which provides survival solutions to the victim as well as call for help via GPS based location.

Why is the idea beneficial?
-The above mentioned utilities aren’t generally available in a single bundle especially in a country like India which is facing a technological boom with exponentially rising number of mobile and internet users. Hence, an idea like ours will help a large number of people in the upcoming times as our country is prone to disasters.

IMPLEMENTATION
-The idea is implemented using a mobile android application. Android was chosen as the Platform due to its massive usage in our country. 
The prediction mechanism utilises Machine Learning Algorithms by using a vast database containing various geographical characteristics such as Topography, Latitude, Rainfall Activity, Tectonic plate movements, Altitude etc. to predict the possibility of a disaster in a certain region. This is a part of the backend of the application.

-Secondly, the application utilises the user’s GPS location. In case of a calamity, it blocks the internet utilisation of other apps in a mobile and switches the mobile to battery saving mode so that the user can also utilise the internet to alert the concerned authorities and their families about their location and their safety.

-The Offline Mode contains a survival guide for various disasters which can be of immense importance during a calamity and save a person’s life. The Mode also utilises the GPS location to generate the helpline numbers of concerned authorities nearby.
